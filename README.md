Week-3 Project

Learning Outcomes
Understanding the data provided and extracting insight. You will have to explore different techniques, algorithms, statistical distributions, sampling, and visualization techniques to gain insight.
Understand the data structure and algorithms used in EDA and machine learning pipelines.
Modular and object-oriented Python code writing. Python package building. 
Statistical Modeling and Analysis. You will have to use statistical models to predict and analyze the outcomes of A/B tests, applying techniques such as logistic regression, or chi-squared tests, as appropriate to the hypotheses being tested.
A/B Testing Design and Implementation. You will design robust A/B tests that can yield clear, actionable results. This includes determining the sample size, selecting control and test groups, and defining success metrics.
Data Versioning. You will manage and document versions of datasets and analysis results.
